## ðŸ“œ What is Aramaic?
Aramaic is an ancient **Semitic language** that has been spoken for over 3,000 years. It was once the dominant language of the **Near East**, used by the **Arameans, Assyrians, Babylonian, and Persian Empires**. 

ðŸ”¹ **Jesus Christ** and his disciples spoke Aramaic.  
ðŸ”¹ Some parts of the **Old Testament** (Hebrew Bible) and the **Talmud** were written in Aramaic.  
ðŸ”¹ It is still spoken today in a few communities, including in **Ma'lula,Bax'a,Jubb'adin and other regions in Syria**, where the **Aramaic** language is still used.  

This translator(so far) is based on words from the **Ma'lula dialect**, one of the last surviving forms of Western Aramaic.
